# New Tab Google
Tired of all of those gimmicky, heavy new tab pages you always see on the chrome app store? Hate seeing the "Most visited" sites and wish you could see your Gmail, Notifications, and Google Account dashboard on your new tab page? Then install this extension!
## Why?
I wanted to set Google to my new tab page because I hated always looking at my most visited sites. They were inaccurate, with old thumbnails and wildly incorrect assumptions about what I looked at. So I decided to make a simple extension to redirect the user to chrome when they opened a new tab.

Astonishingly, there is no way to set your new tab page in Google Chrome other than to use an extension. So I had to make this for all of those disadvantaged people, being judged for incorrect most-visited sites and not being able to do anything about it.
## Installation instructions
#### Packed (recommended)
You can install this extension by going to the release folder, downloading the most recent `.crx` file, and dragging it into `chrome://extensions`.
#### Unpacked (If you want to make changes)
You can install the unpacked extension by:
* Downloading the `source` folder.
* Going to `chrome://extensions` and checking the `Developer Mode` box in the top right.
* Clicking the `Load unpacked extension...` button, and selecting the source folder you downloaded.

After that, you can open `chromeredirect.js` and change the URL there to whatever you want to, effectively making the extension a new-tab redirect to whatever you want.
